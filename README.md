  <h1>We've Never Met: Card inventory tracker/manager thing</h1>
  <p>This is all the code so far...you'll need to clone the repo locally and run the app.py file locally to view the webapp</p>

  <h2>1. Clone the Repository</h2>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/darbster145/INFO4410.git</code></pre>

  <h2>2. Run the App</h2>
  <p>Start the app with:</p>
  <pre><code>python app.py</code></pre>
  <p>Then open your browser and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000</a></p>

  <h3>Supabase API keys</h3>
  <p>This is just for the school project so I didn't think it was a big deal to leave the api keys in the code.</p>
  <p>If we really care about that we can look into creating a code folder to reference in our code that holds the api keys</p>
